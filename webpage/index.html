        <h2>About:</h2>
        <p>The 1995 film Whisper of the Heart adapted from the manga of the same name is about a young girl, Shizuku Tsukishima, preparing for the middle <br>
            school exams that determine the college that one goes to in high school. We see her journey through finding a passion and striving for perfection <br>
             it, navigating the young love that stumbles upon the way and some supportive people that help our girl through it. <br>  </p>
        <p>
        The movie form the start has the calm vibes of a Studio Ghibli film unlike others it does not have have heavy magic elements but is more grounded <br>
        in the magic of human experience. The movie highlights the tough journey that every artist has in this society. Despite the very supportive <br>
         elders and friends Shizuku does doubt her passion and dreams as a young writer and fears failure. It also have that light middle school fun, <br>
         and themes of young love.</p>

            <h2>Passion and Dreams:</h2>
            <p> A little girl in her room with her nose in books, this is how the journey of most budding authors begins . We can see it in Shizuku’s <br>
                thirst for a magical adventure that she is waiting to be whisked away into one and thus follows the cat that she thinks is magical. <br>
                My favorite scene would have to he the scene where Shizuku for the first time shows the first draft of her first novel to Seiji’s <br>
                grandfather, the burst of tears at the approval and the revelations of doubt and failure contribute to a very emotional scene that <br>
                most people can relate to. On the other hand, the story of Seji, who knows just what he wants to do and taking all the right steps needed <br>
                to fulfil his passion and dreams but still having the doubts of not being good enough. Both the stories have the rawness of youth in it. <br>
            </p>

            <h2>Love Life and Parents:</h2>
            <p>
                Towards the end of the middle school every one would have their experience with crushes, nosy friends and lots of one-sided love. <br>
                As the story goes we see the potential love growing between Seji and Shizuku , despite their initial differences both seem to be <br>
                more compatible than we think. They complement each other really well, always encouraging and motivating the other. Through Seiji’s <br>
                 determination we witness Shizuku feeling empowered too. In a scene where Seiji laboriously tries to cycle on an uphill road with <br>
                 Shizuku on the back, she quickly gets down, saying <i>“I am no man’s burden! I want to be helpful.” </i> pushing it along, ensuring they <br>
                  both enjoy the moment equally. <br>
                We also witness that Shizuku has very supportive parents, even though they do not understand he dream do not pressure <br>
                her into anything but also educate her that she will be the sole bearer of the consequences of the choices in life. <br>
